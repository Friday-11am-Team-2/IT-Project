# AuthorGuard - IT Project

### Overview
This project is a web-based interface to allow non-technical users to use stylographic technologies to detect plagiarism in academic writing. This usable interface, branded with the name “AuthorGuard” is a full-stack web application that leverages powerful modern day machine learning techniques to detect with a high level of accuracy the likelihood that a given piece of writing was written by a particular individual. 

The development team aims to deliver a functional, efficient and easy to use web-application to allow for the usage of these machine learning algorithms by a non-technical academic audience to help protect authorial integrity in an era of Large Language Models & Contract Cheating.
